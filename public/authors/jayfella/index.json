Everybody can register and submit their software!\nhttps://store.jmonkeyengine.org/   Currently only free open-source software can be submitted. Once we have the sponsorship required for the legal documentation and setup fees we will be able to allow selling (payment required to use it) and sponsoring (pay the developer if you want to as a thank you) software."   ,
