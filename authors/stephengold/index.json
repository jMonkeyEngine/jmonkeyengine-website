In its wake, the JMonkeyEngine team came together and identified a handful of existing fixes that could be safely backported into v3.3. With the help of volunteers, candidate builds received extensive testing on multiple platforms. Their efforts culminated in version 3.3.2-stable, a production-ready patch release from the v3.3 line.\n"   ,
