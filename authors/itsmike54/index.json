        "summary":"After 3 months of beta testing, the Java game engine\u0026rsquo;s long-awaited v3.3 release arrived on 30 March.\nWith it came exciting new features: AppState ids, light-probe blending, a better ragdoll control, and an animation system rewritten from the ground up.\nAs often happens, a few key bugfixes missed the cutoff for v3.3.0-stable. In its wake, the JMonkeyEngine team came together and identified a handful of existing fixes that could be safely backported into v3.3. With the help of volunteers, candidate builds received extensive testing on multiple platforms. Their efforts culminated in version 3.3.2-stable, a production-ready patch release from the v3.3 line.\n"   ,
