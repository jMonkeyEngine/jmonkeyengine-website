The JMonkeyEngine team is proud to announce the 3.4.1-stable release of its 3-D game engine for Java programmers. JMonkeyEngine 3.4.1 is an interim release that patches a handful of bugs and performance issues discovered in the JME 3.4 libraries since they became generally available in May.

Alpha testing has already begun on JME 3.5, which is planned for general availability in early 2022. JME 3.5 will introduce a few new features and also many refinements.

The 3.4.1-stable libraries are available from the Maven Central repository under the "org.jmonkeyengine" group ID.

To browse the change list and the source code, go to https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/releases/tag/v3.4.1-stable

At this time, there's no Software Development Kit (SDK) built specifically for JME 3.4 . However, development using the JME 3.4.1 libraries can proceed using the JME 3.3 SDK (based on Netbeans 11) or a general-purpose IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA.
