We're proud to announce the release of version 3.7.0-stable of the JMonkeyEngine game engine.
And here's a big "thank you!" to Adi Barda, who managed that release.

The new release is featured in [version v3.7.0-stable-sdk2 of our Software Development Kit](https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine/sdk/releases/tag/v3.7.0-stable-sdk2).
Pre-compiled libraries are available from the Maven Central repository under the "org.jmonkeyengine" groupID.
Release notes are online at https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/releases/tag/v3.7.0-stable

Development of a 3.8 release has already begun. Ryan McDonough is managing that effort. Please support him in any way you can.
